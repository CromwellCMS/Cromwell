## Examples

There are two production-ready examples of how your website can look out the box. No development or programming skills needed.

### Default. Online store.

Right after installation you get a free full-featured online store.

**Example frontend**: https://demo-store.cromwellcms.com/  
**Example admin panel**: https://demo-store.cromwellcms.com/admin  

Admin panel credentials for a guest user:  
email: `guest@example.com`  
password: `qwerty`  

The theme includes:
- Customer account page with order history
- Modifiable home page with gallery and banners
- Product categories with filtration
- Search
- Customer reviews
- Quick-view
- Save product as favorite
- Related products
- Blog

### Secondary. Blog.

While previous theme includes both store and blog, you may want more simple website. Blog is a second theme available after installation, so you need just to switch to it in the admin panel. Also, you may want to tweak navigation menu in Main menu Plugin's interface.
