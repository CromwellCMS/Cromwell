# Theme development

Cromwell CMS follows principles of headless CMS where API server can run separately without its frontend server. So basically you can create any type of frontend and host it wherever you like. But in this scenario you need to manage and deploy this frontend by yourself. Cromwell CMS provides a way to build Theme that can be managed and can work the CMS core. CMS users can easily install Theme from official market right in their Admin panel GUI, make active, delete them, change layout in the Page Builder as long as themes follow the set of rules we are going to show.  

Cromwell CMS Theme is a Next.js app. Theme development is basically Next.js development. If you are not familiar with Next.js, [you should definitely start with it first](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
