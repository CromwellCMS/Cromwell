# Mail

E-mailing is a required feature of every CMS for sending transactional e-mails, password resets, order placements, etc.  
By default Cromwell CMS sends emails with resources of [Node.js server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sendmail). But often you may notice that messages end up in a "spam" folder or never reach an address. That usually happens with self-hosted servers because email service providers don't trust them without proper configuration.

To fix the situation Cromwell CMS provides integration with SMTP service providers. You can choose a provider dependent on your needs or preferences, for integration to work you have to provide a [connection string](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/) in the form: `smtps://username:password@smtp.example.com`  

We do not promote any provider, but just for the sake of example there is a short instruction how to setup [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/).  
- [Create an account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/)
- [Create a new sender](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders/new)
- [Create API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/guide/integrate/langs/smtp) 
- Create connection string with your key: `smtps://apikey:YOUR_API_KEY@smtp.sendgrid.net`, so it will look like: `smtps://apikey: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@smtp.sendgrid.net`
- Go to the Admin panel > Settings page > scroll to E-mailing settings. In "Send e-mails from" paste e-mail address you submitted for a Sendgrid sender in field "From Email Address". Paste your connection string in the field below.


## Templates

Emailing templates can be fully customized for your website.  
Navigate to [`.cromwell/server/emails`](/docs/overview/installation#working-directories) directory. There are copied number of templates:
- `order.hbs` - For new order placement
- `forgot-password.hbs` - Email with secret code when user starts reset-password transaction.

The CMS use [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) as templating engine. You can edit CMS templates as you like, just keep Handlebars variables to insert data.

:::important
Make a backup of your custom template. When you run CMS update, it may replace your templates with new ones. Your templates may become incompatible if some variables change in original template.
