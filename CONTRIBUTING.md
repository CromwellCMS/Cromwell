Wait for team members to leave a feedback on your issue.

## Setup

Read [Core development guide](https://github.com/CromwellCMS/Cromwell/tree/master/system)

## Submitting Changes

Workflow:

- For a major fix/feature make sure your PR has an issue and if it doesn't, please create one. This would help discussion with the community, and polishing ideas in case of a new feature.
- Create a fork of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CromwellCMS/Cromwell).
- Crate a new git branch with name of your feature/bug
- Commit your changes into the branch.
- Create a pull request at GitHub website to the master branch of our repository.
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. ([More info](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests))

Follow these guidelines while working:

- Follow the existing coding style
- Write a [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- When you have a lot of commits in your PR, it's good practice to squash all your commits in one single commit. ([Learn how to squash here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))
